- added a show case for providing and consuming implementations of custom displays that might be shared as a npm module
- upgraded to TypeScriptToLua 1.4.2
## 1.0.2
- show cases two custom displays that are imported into display.ts. This proves that you can have custom displays in separate files and donÂ´t have to care about concatenating them which done by tstl for you. Note that for now, this is still just a functional approach and not object-oriented.
